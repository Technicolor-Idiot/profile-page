              Photography has always been my therapy. It gave me a chance to look at the world differently, to see the many facets of it through one eye. As a photograper I've spent hours alone, walking and taking in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some see it as a lonely practice. Walking for hours by yourself. However, it is no less different from a painter at a canvas or a ceramacist making a sculpture. Like Photography, these forms require a person to be alone.
            </p>
            <p>
              It let me also know myself. To know what I like and what I am drawn towards. To notice one second where you see something incredible while others might see nothing at all. It is those little moments that I live for.
